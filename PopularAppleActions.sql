/*
Write a query to determine the top 5 actions performed during the month of November 2020, for actions performed on an Apple platform (iPhone, iPad).

The events table tracks every time a user performs a certain action (like post_enter, etc.) on a platform (android, web, etc.).

The output should include the action performed and itâ€™s rank in ascending order. If two actions are performed equally, they should have the same rank.
